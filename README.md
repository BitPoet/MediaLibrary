Simple Media Library Module for the ProcessWire CMS

## Status

Beta

## Compatibility

Currently tested with PW 2.7 and PW 3.0.

## Description

This module adds a MediaLibrary template with MediaImages and MediaFiles fields to ProcessWire.

Extends CKEditor's link and image pickers to allow quick selection of library pages. Only libraries under the edited page itself or one of its parents are available to keep things organized.
